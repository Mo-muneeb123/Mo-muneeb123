## Hi there 👋

✋ Hi, I am a junior Computer Science and Mathematics student at Wayne State University passionate about using technology to build impactful solutions.

🌆 I am located in Detroit, Michigan and am interested in Software Engineering, Cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

💻 Technical Skills:
- Programming Languages: Python, C++, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, Java, and Swift. 
- Frameworks & Tools: React, NodeJS, Flask, AWS, Git, MongoDB
- Cloud & DevOps: Currently learning cloud computing concepts, Google Cloud, and DevOps practices including version control (Git) and infrastructure as code (Terraform)

👨‍💻 I have experience as a Software Implementation intern at Henkel and as a programming instructor at iCode and the Wayne State Engineering Camp.

💡 I'm eager to actively contribute to projects in cloud computing and software development, while simultaneously advancing my technical skill set and career.

🏋️‍♂️ Outside of Tech, I like to lift weights, play sports, watch the Detroit Lions and build side projects.

🤝 If you are interested in connecting and discussing potential internship opportunities or just want to chat please feel free to do so!
